## Overview

Very interesting challenge, it helped me a lot to improve on js, especially when using forEach.

### The challenge

The focus of the challenge was navigation on both desktop and mobile.

## My process

I didn't have any difficulty with HTML, I was able to do everything without any problems, I didn't have any problems with CSS either and JS had a little bit of a problem with it being very verbose, but after researching I managed to make it less verbose, using the forEach loop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Eu aprendi mais sobre o uso do forEach.

### Continued development

I need to evolve even further in the use of forEach.
